## Introduction
This DDoS Attack Detection Model is a machine learning model built using the Xgboost and Keras frameworks. It is designed to detect and classify Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in network traffic data. This model can help network administrators and security professionals identify and mitigate potential DDoS attacks, enhancing the overall security of their systems.

In this project, I leverage the power of Xgboost, an optimized gradient boosting library, and Keras, a popular deep learning framework, to develop a robust and accurate DDoS attack detection system. The model is trained on labeled network traffic data, enabling it to learn patterns and characteristics of DDoS attacks and make predictions on unseen data.

## Features
- Utilizes Xgboost and Keras frameworks for building the detection model
- Accurately identifies DDoS attacks in network traffic data
- Customizable and adaptable to different network environments

## Installation
To install and run the DDoS Attack Detection Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aarinda/ddos-detection-model.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the labeled network traffic dataset for training the model. There is more information about this in the data directory.
